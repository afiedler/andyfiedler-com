        Workaround: Google Apps for Business won't automatically add flights to your calendar
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">25 May 2015</span>

    <p>My personal gmail account has a great feature where it will automatically add flights to my calendar. It even figures out time zones, which is awesome.</p>

<p><a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6084018?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Apps for Business doesn’t have this feature</a>, which is a shame. As a workaround, you can forward your flight confirmations from your work email to your personal Gmail account. Just be sure to change the title of the email so it doesn’t have the “Fwd:” prefix, and remove the froward headers from the email body (just select them and hit delete).</p>

<p>Your personal Gmail will now think these are new flight confirmations and add them to your personal calendar! Here’s to hoping Google gets this feature in Google Apps for Business.</p>

        Mapbox Studio Creation - OSM Hiking Map

    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">13 May 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve been experimenting with <a title="Mapbox Studio" href="https://www.mapbox.com/mapbox-studio" target="_blank">Mapbox Studio</a>, which is an awesome way to create maps without the pain of setting up a server or downloading Open Street Map data.</p>

<p>The way Mapbox Studio works is that Mapbox has pre-rendered vector tiles from Open Street Map at all 22 standard zoom levels. Mapbox has also pre-rendered hill shading tiles and contour lines! You just need to style them with CartoCSS, which is as easy as it sounds (if you know CSS).</p>

<p>They have a bunch of great starter styles, one of which is Mapbox Outdoors. I modified that to make it a little better for hiking by adjusting the trail labels and making trails more prominent.</p>

<p>You can get the <a title="Hiking Map CartoCSS" href="https://github.com/afiedler/hiking-map.tm2" target="_blank">CartoCSS for the hiking map here</a> and see a <a title="Hiking Map Demo" href="https://api.tiles.mapbox.com/v4/afiedler.e83d82a2/page.html?access_token=pk.eyJ1IjoiYWZpZWRsZXIiLCJhIjoiN2c5VFFRSSJ9.45nCmyDqG5vpSOuHnCj0qQ#15/38.9863/-77.2362" target="_blank">demo of the hiking map here</a>.</p>

        Lodash&#47;Underscore on Google App Script
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">12 Mar 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve recently been working on a Google App Script project, and wanted to use Underscore or Lodash because writing Javascript is relatively painful without those libraries. The problem is that Lodash does a lot of feature detection by trying to throw exceptions, and the Google App Script debugger pauses on all exceptions.</p>

<p>The fix is to just modify Lodash slightly to hard-code the Google App Script features that throw exceptions. This isn’t too hard to do, but it is a pain, so I’ve posted my <a title="Lodash modified for Google App Script" href="https://gist.github.com/afiedler/261a20ac4c7e7befc40e" target="_blank">modified version of Lodash as a Gist here</a>.</p>

    <h4>1) InVision and Sketch</h4>
<p>I’ve been making a lot of simple prototypes in the last few weeks, and the combination of tools that has been working best for me is <a href="http://bohemiancoding.com/sketch/" target="_blank">Sketch 3</a> and <a href="http://www.invisionapp.com/" target="_blank">InVision</a>. Sketch is a simple drawing program like Illustrator that you can use to make mockups. It allows you to have one file with multiple pages, which you can use for multiple screens in your app.</p>

<p>InVision is a very simple online tool to create clickable prototypes. There are lots of these tools, and here is a good comparison, but for me, InVision has been working best because it is very simple. The way InVision works is you upload a bunch of screens and then draw boxes on them that become “hotlinks” to navigate to other screens. You cannot make more complex interactions, like with a tool like Axure, but for the simple prototypes I have been doing, this is all I need. You can learn to use InVision in about 10 minutes, while it took me 3-4 hours to figure out what the heck was going with Axure (not to knock Axure; it’s very powerful and is the right tool for the job sometimes).</p>

<p>The cool thing with the pair of InVision and Sketch is that you can just drag and drop your Sketch file into InVision, and InVision will create or <em>update</em> your screens. That means your revision workflow is very easy: make or update drawings in Sketch → save the file → drag the file to InVision.</p>

<p> </p>
<h4>2) IPython, IRuby, Jupyter</h4>
<p>If you have ever used a REPL and wished it had more of a GUI, you should definitely check out <a href="http://ipython.org/" target="_blank">IPython</a> or <a href="https://github.com/minad/iruby" target="_blank">IRuby</a> (and the upcoming project <a href="http://jupyter.org/" target="_blank">Jupyter</a>). I used IPython in the past, but I’ve been mostly coding Ruby recently. I didn’t realize that there is a very good Ruby counterpart called IRuby that is extremely powerful.</p>

<p>It turns out that IPython is morphing into Jupyter, which aims to be language-agnostic. This could be very cool: think IPython for NodeJS, R, or other languages, and more front-ends that work with any language!</p>

        Hacking Sleep
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">27 Feb 2015</span>

    <p>I’ve been hearing more and more about the importance of sleep, so as part of trying to be healthier in general I decided to see what I could do to sleep better. A lot of the stuff I tried is based on Tim Ferriss’s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-4-Hour-Body-Incredible-Superhuman/dp/0307704610"><em>Four Hour Body</em></a>, and I’d definitely recommend the chapter on sleep to anyone who is interested in hacking theirs, too.</p>

<p>I organized these by what I think worked the best for me, but since I tried a lot of things at once, it’s hard to tease out the differences.</p>

<h2 id="make-your-bedroom-as-dark-as-possible">Make your bedroom as dark as possible</h2>
<p>My apartment is in a historic building, so the facade is lit up at night. While it looks impressive, it makes my bedroom bright even with blackout curtains. What I did to fix this was unfurl a blackout curtain and tack it to the edges of the window so there is practically no light that comes in. By no light, I mean I cannot even see my hand in front of my face. It does not look great, but it works!</p>

<p>Try this first: remove all electronics with lights (even small LEDs) and black out your windows. Use a heavy blanket or aluminum foil and tape. It will look terrible, but if it helps, you can invest in better curtains later.</p>

<h2 id="test-66-70f-degrees-as-your-bedroom-temperature-with-a-thin-blanket">Test 66-70F degrees as your bedroom temperature, with a thin blanket</h2>
<p>This is from the <em>Four Hour Body</em> and it really made a big difference for me. 64 degrees and I’ll wake up shivering, 72 degrees and I’ll sweat and wake up mildly dehydrated. Try 68 with a sheet and maybe a light blanket.</p>

<p>Also, thermostats can be widely inaccurate so you might want to get a more accurate thermometer to test this. For example, if I set my thermostat to 65 degrees, its actually 72 in my bedroom. Try <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013BKDO8">this one</a> that I was using for a few months. It doesn’t really seem to help except maybe on the margins in the darkest days of winter.</p>

<h2 id="humidity-level-was-more-important-than-i-thought">Humidity level was more important than I thought</h2>

<p>I went skiing in the mountains a few weeks ago and got a cold due to the very dry air. I also slept really poorly. I thought - maybe humidity is screwing up my sleep at home, too.</p>

<p>I had a humidifier that I never used, so I decided to try it. Turns out 40-45% relative humidity is ideal. This is also a narrow band like temperature. Below 40% and I’ll wake up with a dry throat and over 50% and everything feels somewhat damp in the morning. I actually sleep pretty well at 50-55% humidity, but I’m concerned about mold growing at that high of a level.</p>

<h2 id="eat-almond-butter-on-a-carrot-before-bed">Eat almond butter on a carrot before bed</h2>

<p>This idea is also from the <em>Four Hour Body</em>. A lot times when I woke up feeling sluggish in the morning, I’d feel better after eating breakfast. I figured this was definitely blood sugar related, so I tried another 4HB suggestion-almond butter before bed.</p>

<p>This worked well and mostly eliminated that groggy mornings. I found that the easiest way to do this was to buy a bag of carrots and a jar of almond butter. Eat one to two carrots, “double dipping” in the almond butter so you get the equivalent of three to four tablespoons. The carrots are great because there will be no spoons or plates to clean up, and takes less than 5 minutes.</p>

<h2 id="things-that-havent-caused-much-of-a-difference-for-me">Things that haven’t caused much of a difference for me</h2>

<ul>
	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Screen time before bed. I have <a href="http://justgetflux.com" target="_blank">f.lux</a> on my Mac and similar apps on my phone and tablet, so this might be a different story if I didn't have those.</span></li>
	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">Melatonin doesn't seem to do much for me, though I sometimes take it when traveling for jet-lag and it helps a bit.</span></li>
	<li class="p1"><span class="s1">I also have a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Philips-goLITE-BLU-Therapy-Device/dp/B001I45XL8/" target="_blank">Phillips goLITE</a> that I was using for a few months. It doesn't really seem to help except maybe on the margins in the darkest days of winter.</span></li>
