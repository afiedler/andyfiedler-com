<p>My name is Andy Fiedler, and that&rsquo;s how I cleverly got the name for this site. I&rsquo;m currently a freelancer based in Washington, DC.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m interested in all sorts of ways to use technology to solve problems in business, local and international economic development. I graduated Rutgers University in 2009 with a B.S., double majoring in Biomedical Engineering and Economics. After that, I worked at the Federal Reserve Board in the International Finance research department. There, I developed a variety of financial models in sovereign debt, foreign exchange, and commodities futures. I also wrote a high-frequency timeseries database system, which is in the process of being open sourced here.</p>
<p>Outside of technology, I&rsquo;m an avid runner, hiker, and attempt to do triathlons without drowning.</p>
