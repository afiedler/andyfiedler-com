This is a excellent book that details a one-week work plan for a design sprint. While the idea of a design sprint isn't
new, I haven't seen another book explain the concept as well or provide as much detail as this one. There is plenty of
practical advice, including separate facilitator notes that are invaluable for someone who wants to run a design sprint
for the first time.

Below are my notes that I took while I read the book and after doing a design sprint myself.

### Notes After My First Design Sprint
On Monday, the two most important outputs are **the business goal** and **the sprint question**. When I did this the
first time through, we had a clear business goal, but a less-than-precise sprint question. It would have been better if
we had a precise question to refer back to after the sprint was finished.

It is possible to do Wednesday through Thursday remotely, especially if the team members building the prototype are used
to working remotely. It isn't ideal, but it is possible if you don't have the budget to keep everyone in the same room.

Overall, this process it very effective for getting a team that is running in different directions on the same page. It
can be used to get a distributed team pulling in the same direction, and it is a good way to get contributions from team
members that are typically very operational and less involved in the day-to-day creative process of building your
company's product.

### One Week Work Plan for a Design Sprint
#### Monday
* Define a long-term goal
* Make a map of the challenge
* Ask the experts
* Pick a target

If you went six months into the future, what would have improved about your business as a result of this project? It's
OK to be aspirational here.

**Write the long-term goal on the whiteboard.**

Next, ferret out the assumptions for this goal. If this project doesn't succeed, what probably went wrong? To reach our
long-term goal, what has to be true?

Rephrase assumptions as questions. Example assumption: "To reach new customers, they have to trust our expertise";
rephrased as a question: "Will new customers trust our expertise?"

**Write sprint questions on the whiteboard.**

Make a map of how people interact with your business. List the people on the left, and map out the actions and
interactions that these people make with each other and your business. The right-most action should relate to your goal
for the sprint (eg, "Buy" or "Sign Up")

**Draw map on the whiteboard**

Next, interview experts. It's suggested that you keep interviews to 30 minutes and ask questions like:

* Is there anything you'd add to the map?
* Is this the correct goal?
* What do you know about each steps of the map?

While you are interviewing, take notes in "How Might We" (HMW) format (eg: "How might we develop trust in our customers?").

Finally, pick a target.

**The decider should choose one target CUSTOMER and one target EVENT**. One or more of the sprint questions should line
up with the target.

#### Tuesday
* Three-minute demos of existing solutions to HMW questions
* Sketch lo-fi prototypes

For the demos, they can come from any industry or any product.

The sketches can be ugly, but *words matter*, so any copy on the sketch should be realistic.

#### Wednesday
* Put dots on standout ideas in the sketches. Put questions below on sticky notes.
* Critique sketches verbally (creator of the sketch responding)
* Make a storyboard

The storyboard should start with an opening scene. Think about what customers are doing just before they interact with
your product. Ideally your opening scene should place your product next to your competitors. If you are testing multiple
solutions, your opening scene should pose your different solutions as different competitors.

Example opening scenes:

* Google search results
* iTunes or Android app stores
* Amazon search results
* Trade magazine
* Newspaper article
* Facebook or Twitter feed

Storyboarding rule of thumb: each frame is one minute of your actual user test. Aim for fifteen frames.

#### Thursday
The main purpose of Thursday is to build your prototype that you will user test. Some tips for creating a prototype:

* It must look "real", meaning that you don't want your test customers giving you feedback on implementation. But it can
be less real than you think. Think about how a well-executed play with very little in the way of props of costumes can
still be engrossing. That's what you are going for.
* You should not spend more than one day on the prototype. If you spend more time, you will become too invested in the
solution.
* Focus the fidelity of your prototype on the areas that will help answer your sprint questions.
* This seemed obvious to me, but they reiterate the importance of *not* using your usual tools. Web developers should
use something like InVision or Keynote, not actual code!

Another good suggestion is to have a designated Writer: one person responsible for copy. If more than one person is a
copywriter, the language won't mesh well.

#### Friday
Friday is user interview day. Here's some tips that I found useful for user interviews:

* Five people is the right number. The book quotes a UX designer saying that 85 percent of problems were uncovered with
five interviews.
* Have the rest of the team watch the interviews remotely via screen share or video chat. This saves time from writing
tedious recaps. Also, written recaps for the team always loose some fidelity. So if possible, just have the team watch.
* Use the five act interview: 1) friendly intro, 2) open-ended context questions, 3) introduction to prototype, 4)
detailed tasks to get the customer engaging with the prototype, 5) debrief
