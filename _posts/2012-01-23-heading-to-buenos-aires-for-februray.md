<p>The next four weeks are going to be a whirlwind of travelling: Miami for the Miama Half Marathon, then on to Buenos Aires for most of February.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve wanted to go to Argentina for a while now, but kept putting off the trip for a variety of reasons: no time, no money, the usual. I though about going a few months ago, but at the time decided to put it off, yet again, for the same reasons. Then, this winter, with a fairly flexible work schedule, a friend who can sublet my apartment in DC, and dirt cheap flights from Miami, I realized that now was the time to go!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll be staying in Buenos Aires for most of the time, working during the day and taking Spanish classes at night. I&rsquo;m planning a few weekend trips to Uruguay (Montevideo) and possibly Mendoza for some hiking. Stay tuned for photos from the trip.</p>
