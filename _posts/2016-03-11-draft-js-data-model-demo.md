Facebook released a very interesting [React-based rich text editor called Draft.js](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/). The advantage of something like is that you have much more control over the data model for structured documents.

The documentation is a little sparse on examples of what the underlying data model looks like, so I build this quick demo that renders the data model in JSON.

[See it live here](http://afiedler.github.io/draft-js-dm-demo/).
