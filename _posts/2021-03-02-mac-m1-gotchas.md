## Development

### Visual Studio Code
* Need to use the Insiders edition
* The Terminal runs in ARM64 mode, so if you want to run programs via Rosetta 2, you need to use `arch -x86_64 <command>`

### NodeJS
* No prebuild ARM64 package, so it needs to compile. Node v14.16 compiled successfully for me!
