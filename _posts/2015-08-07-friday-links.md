* **Music I'm rocking out to** -- [Two Hearts](https://open.spotify.com/track/5dCQryKQ6LPT50PBXnZfQy) by The Features and [Firestone](https://open.spotify.com/track/2sNvitW3TxiTeC9xT9f2ZZ) by Kygo.
* **Interesting read** -- The NYTimes has a [great article](http://www.nytimes.com/2015/08/08/us/politics/fox-news-moderators-bring-a-sharpened-edge-to-gop-debate-stage.html?_r=0) praising the Fox News coverage of the Republican debate. I agree with it, the Fox moderators were almost Jon Stewart-esque!
* **Tools and tech** -- I've been experimenting with different development environments for NodeJS, and the winner so far is JetBrain's [WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/). Code completion support is excellent, and the integrated Node debugger is a huge time saver. At $49, it's a no-brainer if you do any kind of Javascript development.
