My personal gmail account has a great feature where it will automatically add flights to my calendar. It even figures out time zones, which is awesome.

<a href="https://support.google.com/calendar/answer/6084018?hl=en" target="_blank">Google Apps for Business doesn't have this feature</a>, which is a shame. As a workaround, you can forward your flight confirmations from your work email to your personal Gmail account. Just be sure to change the title of the email so it doesn't have the "Fwd:" prefix, and remove the froward headers from the email body (just select them and hit delete).

Your personal Gmail will now think these are new flight confirmations and add them to your personal calendar! Here's to hoping Google gets this feature in Google Apps for Business.
