        Using TSDB to store U.S. Equities data from TickData
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">06 Jul 2012</span>

    <p>In this article, I'll show you how to use my&nbsp;<a title="Time Series Database" href="http:&#47;&#47;andyfiedler.com&#47;projects&#47;time-series-database&#47;">Time Series Database&lt;&#47;a&gt; to import some sample U.S. equities data from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com">TickData&lt;&#47;a&gt;, a data provider of high-frequency historical financial data. First, get the <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com&#47;downloads&#47;SampleEquityData_US.zip">sample data&lt;&#47;a&gt; and unzip it on your computer. Look in the Quotes folder for a file called GLP_27667.asc. This is file has quotes for Global Partners LP, a petroleum company. If you are running on Mac OS X or Linux, you can use the <code>head&lt;&#47;code&gt; command to see the first few lines, which in my download look like this:&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">11&#47;01&#47;2011,04:00:00.301,P,14.5,21.36,5,1,R,,175,P,P,1,2,,C<br />

If you look on TickData's website, you can find a <a title="U.S. Equities TickData Format Definition" href="http:&#47;&#47;www.tickdata.com&#47;pdf&#47;TickData_File_Format_Overview_US_Equities.pdf">document describing the format&lt;&#47;a&gt; of these files in detail, but for this example, we're only going to look at the first 7 fields.&lt;/p&gt;
<ul>
<li>Date (MM&#47;DD&#47;YYYY)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Time&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Exchange indicator (P means ARCA, M means Chicago, T means NASD)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Bid Price&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Ask Price&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Bid Amount (100 share lots)&lt;&#47;li&gt;
<li>Ask Amount (100 share lots)&lt;&#47;li&gt;<br />
&lt;&#47;ul&gt;<br />
Let's create a new TSDB file to store this data. To do this, use the tsdbcreate command.&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:sh decode:true">tsdbcreate glp.tsdb quotes char exchange double bid_price double ask_price int32 bid_size int32 ask_size&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
This command is creating a new tsdb database called glp.tsdb with a series called "quotes". That series has 5 columns: exchange (a character), bid_price (floating point double), ask_price (floating point double), bid_size and ask_size (both 32-bit integers).&lt;/p&gt;
<p>You can add more than one series to a TSDB file. If you were to call the tsdbcreate command and glp.tsdb already existed, then it would add another series to the file.</p>
<p>Now that you have an empty TSDB file, we'll create some import instructions and import the data. TSDB has a program called TSDB import that uses an XML file to describe how to parse the delimited data in a file like a CSV file and append it to the end of a time series.&nbsp; Whenever you import data, you are always appending it to the end of a time series.<strong>&nbsp;&lt;&#47;strong&gt;You can import from more than one file into one series in a TSDB file, but you need to start with the earliest file. You also must make sure each of the files you import are in chronological order from oldest timestamp to newest (repeated timestamps are okay).&lt;/p&gt;
<p>Here's an example XML file that shows how you could import the TickData quotes files.</p>
<pre class="lang:xml"><?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?><br />
   <dataimport><br />
      <delimparser field_delim=","><br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="_TDSB_timestamp" type="timestamp"<br />
            tokens="0,1" format_string="%m&#47;%d&#47;%Y %H:%M:%S%F" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="exchange" type="char" tokens="2" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="bid_price" type="double" tokens="3" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="ask_price" type="double" tokens="4" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="bid_amount" type="int32" tokens="5" &#47;&gt;<br />
         &lt;fieldparser name="ask_amount" type="int32" tokens="6" &#47;&gt;<br />
      &lt;&#47;delimparser&gt;<br />
   &lt;&#47;dataimport&gt;&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
The XML import tells the tsdbimport command how to map the comma-separated values in each line into columns in the database. Notice in the timestamp <code>fieldparser&lt;&#47;code&gt; block, we specify to use tokens 0 and 1 to make the timestamp. This tells the parser to join tokens zero and one with a space and then to parse the combined string as a timestamp.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>You can save that XML as a text file called "instructions.xml" and then import the&nbsp;GLP_27667.asc file like this:</p>
<pre class="lang:sh">tsdbimport instructions.xml GLP_27667.asc glp.tsdb quotes&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
After you run this command, you'll have the complete GLP time series imported. Now, you can access this data quickly via either the R or MATLAB TSDB bindings. Stay tuned for a article on how to do that within the next few days.&lt;/p&gt;

        Using Gitolite with Redmine
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">14 May 2012</span>

    <p>I use Gitolite to self-host multiple git projects and Redmine for time-tracking and project management. Redmine has a cool feature where it can integrate with source control management systems, but getting it to work with Gitolite was a bit of a challenge. Here's how I did it.</p>
<p>First, create a new repository in Gitolite. You're going to want to mirror a read-only version somewhere for Redmine to access. Then, we'll keep them synced using a post-receive hook in Git. After you create your new Gitolite repo, login to your server and go to a folder where you'll keep a mirror for Redmine. In this example, I'll use <code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;&lt;&#47;code&gt;. In that folder, type this to create a mirror of your Gitolite repo and, critically, make git change the permissions of new files to 0644 (which gives read access to all users). Note that # means run as root.&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true"># git clone --mirror &#47;home&#47;git&#47;repositories&#47;my-new-repo.git<br />
# cd my-new-repo.git<br />
# git config --add core.sharedRepository 0644&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Now, change the permissions so that the git user (the user that Gitolite runs as) owns this folder.&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true"># chown -R git:git ..&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Finally, we'll add a post-receive hook to the Gitolite repo. Go to <code>&#47;home&#47;git&#47;repositories&#47;my-new-repo.git&#47;hooks&lt;&#47;code&gt;. Add a new file called <code>post-receive&lt;&#47;code&gt;, and enter this into the file:&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true">#!&#47;bin&#47;sh<br />
&#47;usr&#47;bin&#47;git push --mirror &#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
Then, you'll want to change the ownership and permissions on that.&lt;/p&gt;
<pre class="lang:default highlight:0 decode:true crayon-selected"># chown git:git post-receive<br />
# chmod 700 post-receive&lt;&#47;pre&gt;<br />
In Redmine, go to your project you want to associate with this repo. Click the Settings, then Repository tabs. Choose Git as your SCM. In this example, you'd enter <code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrots&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;code&gt; as your repository path. Click "Save".&lt;/p&gt;
<p>Now, click the Repository tab on the top tab bar. You may get a 404 error at this point. That is because you need to push a master branch to this repository (it is empty right now). Push a few files to the repo and check again.</p>
<p>If it is still not working, you can log in to your server and navigate to the mirror location (<code>&#47;var&#47;gitolite-mirrors&#47;my-new-repo.git&lt;&#47;code&gt;). Switch users to the user your Redmine process is running as (probably www-data or something similar). Redmine is running <code>git log master&lt;&#47;code&gt; to get the changes from your repo to display on the webpage. Try running that command and see if you get any errors, and debug from there.&lt;/p&gt;

        Takeaways from Lean Startup Machine DC
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">26 Mar 2012</span>

    <p>Last weekend, I went to <a title="Lean Startup Machine" href="http:&#47;&#47;leanstartupmachine.com&#47;">Lean Startup Machine DC&lt;&#47;a&gt;, which is a weekend-long workshop on applying the principles of Eric Ries' book <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.amazon.com&#47;The-Lean-Startup-Entrepreneurs-Continuous&#47;dp&#47;0307887898">The Lean Startup&lt;&#47;a&gt;. The weekend is incredibly intensive, and we made a lot of progress validating and invalidating some of the assumptions we had for our local peer-to-peer lending platform, <a href="clovest.com">Clovest&lt;&#47;a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>For me the biggest take-away is the importance of talking to your customers early and often. Instead of writing code and building the website, we focused completely on customer interviews, market research, and developing a trial ad campaign to see how interested the community is in this project.</p>
<p>Far too often, technical people (myself included) would rather spend a few hours building something in Rails, or whatever is the current coolest technology, instead of talking with end users. Building software has instant gratification, it feels productive, and the risk is minimal (besides wasting time and getting carpal tunnel syndrome). Talking to people is difficult and uncomfortable, and forces you to consider the possibility that they will reject your idea. However, wouldn't you rather have your idea rejected while its just a sketch on a napkin and not 20,000 lines of code that took 200 man-hours to write? I'd definitely prefer the former, and that's probably the biggest takeaway from the whole lean startup methodology.</p>

      <a href="/2011/09/using-google-nexus-s-china">
        Using the Google Nexus S in China
      </a>
    </h1>

    <span class="post-date">07 Sep 2011</span>

    <p>I just spent two weeks in China visiting Beijing, Xi&rsquo;an, and Shanghai. It was a great trip, but not speaking any Chinese made it rather difficult to get around at times. English is not widely spoken, and even in Shanghai, finding English speakers was difficult. Also, even writing things down was not effective because most Chinese only know the spelling of tourist sites in Chinese characters. I knew this before I left, and figured having my cell phone working in China would be very useful for translation and maps. This proved to be true, and there were a few times where it was really invaluable (for example, showing the Chinese taxi driver my destination on Google Maps, which has English and Chinese names, was often the only way to convey where I wanted to go).</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s how I got my phone, the Google Nexus S, to work in China. This should work with any other unlocked T-Mobile phone, too. First, there are two major cell phone carriers in China: China Mobile, and China Unicom. You&rsquo;ll want to use China Unicom because they have 3G on the 2100 MHz band, which is the same as T-Mobile uses in the US. You can buy a SIM card from many convenience stores in China, or you can order one from <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.3gsolutions.com.cn&#47;page&#47;simcard&#47;">3GSolutions&lt;&#47;a&gt;. I got package 3S96 from them, which is a SIM card with CNY 50 of credit on it. If you order it from them, they will mail it to your hotel for you to pick up upon arrival. This was helpful, but China Unicom stores are ubiquitous in big cities and many convenience stores had SIM cards too.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>After you get your SIM card, you&rsquo;ll want to activate a monthly plan on it. If you don&rsquo;t use a plan, 3G data charges are astronomical. China Unicom only bills by calendar-month, which is a pain if you are arriving at the end a month like I was. However, you can also buy a half-month plan with half the data and call time allowance for half the price for your first calendar month there. 3GSolutions has a good list of the available plans <a href="http:&#47;&#47;www.3gsolutions.com.cn&#47;page&#47;mthplan&#47;">here&lt;&#47;a&gt;. If you get your SIM card from 3GSolutions, they will activate a plan for you, or a least they say they will. Unfortunately, for some reason my monthly plan was not activated when I got my SIM card, and I quickly blew through the credits on it using Google Maps.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>To activate a monthly plan yourself, just call 10010. If you are not in the city where you bought the SIM card when you want to activate a plan, you will need to dial the city code first. For example, my SIM card was purchased in Shanghai, which is city code 021. So, to activate a plan while I was in Beijing, I called 021-10010. There are operators who speak English well, at least on the Shanghai hotline.</p>
<p>So, how much does this all cost? If you go at the end of a month (I arrived on July 24 and was staying until August 4), it will be more expensive since you will need to pay for two months of service. That being said, overall it is not too expensive: CNY 100 for the SIM card with CNY 50 in credits. Then I added CNY 50 by buying a recharge card. I got the CNY 66 monthly plan with 300 MB of data and 50 minutes of calling. For my first week there (in July), I took advantage of the half-price first month deal from China Unicom (CNY 33 for 150 MB and 25 minutes of calling). Then for the few days in August I was there, I was charged CNY 66 for that month. In total, it would have come to CNY 150, and I&rsquo;d be left with a SIM card with CNY 1 on it when I left.</p>
<div>
<p>That&rsquo;s about $23.30, which given the number of times I needed Google Maps&#47;Translator, was definitely worth it. I ended up actually paying a bit more since 3GSolutions charges a&nbsp;commission&nbsp;to get the SIM card and send it to you, and also because somehow my plan wasn&rsquo;t activated at first and I quickly blew through the included credits.</p>
<h1>Getting around the Great Firewall&lt;&#47;h1&gt;<br />
China blocks a lot of websites that websites that we take for granted, and if you really need to access Facebook and Twitter from China, you&rsquo;ll need a VPN. The Nexus S has a built-in VPN client, but it was very flaky for me. If you loose a network connection for any reason (going out or range for wifi or loosing cell service briefly), you&rsquo;ll loose your connection to the VPN. Also, I&rsquo;ve heard reports that PPTP VPNs have been blocked in China, but I couldn&rsquo;t confirm this.&lt;/p&gt;
<p>I experimented with <a href="http:&#47;&#47;billing.purevpn.com&#47;aff.php?aff=453">PureVPN&lt;&#47;a&gt;, which uses IPSec, over China Unicom and it actually worked well. It did not work at all over any wifi hotspot that I tested in China.&lt;/p&gt;
