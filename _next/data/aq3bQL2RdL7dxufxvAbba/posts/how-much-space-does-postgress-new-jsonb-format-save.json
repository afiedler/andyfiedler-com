{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"how-much-space-does-postgress-new-jsonb-format-save","contentHtml":"<p>Postgres 9.4 has a new column format called \"JSONB\" that is a binary representation of JSON. The coolest thing about this new column type is that it supports indexes, so you can now query JSON columns much faster. However, a side benefit is that it is also slightly smaller. I recently did a test where I took a 53 MB table of mostly JSON data and converted it to JSONB. Before and after the conversion I did a <code>VACUUM FULL</code> on the table. Space savings was about 12.3%.</p>\n<p>Just one observation you might want to consider if you are thinking about switching formats.</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"How much space does Postgres's new JSONB format save?","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":341,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=341","date":"2015-09-10 15:42:55 -0400","date_gmt":"2015-09-10 19:42:55 -0400","categories":["Scrapbook"],"tags":["postgres"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
