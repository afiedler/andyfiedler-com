{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"using-the-draft-oauth-assertion-grant-with-google","contentHtml":"<p>The IETF has been working on a new OAuth standard for \"assertions\" which enables OAuth to work with other types of authentication systems. This can be used to allow users to authenticate with your API through Google+ or other third-party identity providers.</p>\n<p>For example, let's say you are developing a single-page Javascript app or a mobile app that uses both Google's APIs as well as your own APIs. You'd like to have users authenticate with Google to obtain access to Google's APIs, but then you'd also like your app to authenticate with your server to gain access to some additional resources. You'd like to not reinvent the wheel and use OAuth for your own API. You also implicitly trust Google to verify the user's identity, so you don't want the user to need to go through another OAuth flow just to use your API.</p>\n<p>Assertion grants allow you to do this in a standards-compliant way. This is a draft standard that was just submitted in July of 2014, but for this simple use-case, it is already fairly usable.</p>\n<p>This \"passing the code to the backend step\" is what OAuth assertion grants enable in a standards-compliant way.</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"Using the Draft OAuth Assertion Grant with Google+","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":283,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=283","date":"2014-09-10 14:38:35 -0400","date_gmt":"2014-09-10 18:38:35 -0400","categories":["Tech Notes","Web Development"],"tags":["oauth","google+"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
