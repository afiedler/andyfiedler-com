{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"tech-predictions-for-2014","contentHtml":"<p>This is a just a bunch of fun tech predictions for 2014. I can't claim any insider knowledge, but it will be interesting to look back on them at the end of the year to see what the outcomes are!</p>\n<p>First, There currently isn’t a good way to \"build your own Heroku\" out of open source components. If Heroku is too constraining, you are forced to spin up your own servers on Amazon Web Services for part of your application, which eliminates lots of the advantages Heroku brings to the table. Last year there was a ton of excitement about Linux containers (LXC) and Docker, which is abstraction on top of LXC that makes them easier to manage. Both Heroku and Google Cloud use Linux containers internally, but they are closed-source implementations. Docker will likely begin to change that this year.</p>\n<p>However, Docker alone is not a Heroku replacement. Much of the innovation in Heroku lies in the build packs and routing mesh, which Docker does not provide. Two other open source projects aim to become that layer on top of Docker, and these are the ones I’m most excited to watch. The first is Deis, which seems to be the furthest along in creating an open-source Heroku. Deis has both a routing mesh and an application layer created as well as scripts to automatically scale your “personal Heroku” on AWS, Digital Ocean and Rackspace. Flynn has many of the same goals, but doesn’t appear to be as far along. Deis has commercial support from Opsware, while Flynn is raising money Kickstarter-style to build out their platform. In any case, while Heroku is great, it is very exciting to see open source competitors come to the scene.</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"Tech Predictions for 2014","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":237,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=237","date":"2014-01-28 16:42:19 -0500","date_gmt":"2014-01-28 21:42:19 -0500","categories":["Uncategorized"],"tags":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
