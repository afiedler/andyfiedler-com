I know that the issue is a few loops that are written in Python instead of using NumPy's optimized vector operations. I'm not exactly sure which loop is the slowest.</p>\n<p>I started trying to get cProfile to work, but ended up with way too much data to be useful. So I reverted to my old school, barebones profiling method: Ctrl-C.</p>\n<p>How do you use this method you might ask? Start your program and randomly hit Ctrl-C. Wherever your program stops most frequently is the probably the slowest part. Speed that up and repeat!</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"The barebones profiling method that is surprisingly effective","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":272,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=272","date":"2014-05-27 08:01:06 -0400","date_gmt":"2014-05-27 12:01:06 -0400","categories":["Tech Notes"],"tags":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
