{"pageProps":{"postData":{"id":"single-page-app-hosting","contentHtml":"<p>If you are working on an MVP web app these days, chances are you are using a single page app (SPA) framework like Angular, React, or EmberJS. These frameworks are great for a lot of reasons, one being that you can typically host the front-end with just a static file webserver like NGINX or Apache.</p>\n<p>Maintaining a webserver is still probably not the best use of your time when you are trying to get your MVP out the door, and hosting a SPA is a little more complex than just a static HTML site. There are a lot of shortcuts out there (such as using Amazon S3) and a few hosted platforms are emerging.

If don't need your app to be indexed on Google, <a href=\"https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug/\" target=\"_blank\">show previews on Facebook's Open Graph</a>, or <a href=\"https://dev.twitter.com/cards/getting-started\" target=\"_blank\">show cards on Twitter</a>, both Firebase Hosting and Aerobatic are good options. In theory, Googlebot is starting to crawl SPAs, but in practice I have not had good luck with that. The other crawlers seem to be far behind Google, so you'll likely need pre-rendered pages, anyway.</p>\n<p>If you do need to support bots by serving pre-rendered HTML, you are unfortunately at a real loss. I think your best option in that case is to host your front-end on Heroku (using NGINX, Express, Hapi, or some other simple server), and use a service like <a href=\"https://prerender.io/\" target=\"_blank\">Prerender.io</a> to serve pre-rendered HTML to bots. See <a href=\"https://gist.github.com/thoop/8165802\" target=\"_blank\">here</a> for how you would set up Prerender.io using NGINX. Alternatively, you can let the Firebase Hosting guys know that you really want pre-rendering support in <a href=\"https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools/issues/33\" target=\"_blank\">this PR</a>.</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"Where Should I Host My Single Page App?","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":345,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=345","date":"2015-11-12 10:45:44 -0500","date_gmt":"2015-11-12 15:45:44 -0500","categories":["Tech Notes"],"tags":["devops","single page apps","hosting"],"redirect_from":["/blog/single-page-app-hosting-345/","/blog/single-page-app-hosting-345"]}},"__N_SSG":true}
