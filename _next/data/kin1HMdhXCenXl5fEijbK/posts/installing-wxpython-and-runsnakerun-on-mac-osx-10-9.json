The Ctrl-C way of profiling worked really well for optimizing append performance of my <a title=\"TsTables Github\" href=\"http://github.com/afiedler/tstables\" target=\"_blank\">time series storage library</a>, but doesn't work so great for profiling things that are already very fast (on the order of milliseconds) and need to be faster.</p>\n<p>For that, RunSnakeRun worked really well. RunSnakeRun gives you a nice rectangle chart showing in which functions your program spends most of its time.</p>\n<p>{% picture wp/uploads/2014/05/Screen-Shot-2014-05-28-at-9.27.01-AM-800x499.png %}</p>\n<p>To install RunSnakeRun on Mac OSX, you'll need Homebrew and PIP. You can install it like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:default highlight:0 decode:true crayon-selected\" title=\"Bash commands to install RunSnakeRun\">$ brew install wxpython --python --devel\n$ pip install SquareMap RunSnakeRun</pre>\n<p>Next, you'll need to export a pstats database with your profiler information. Use cProfile to do this. For TsTables, you can run the benchmark with profiling information like this:</p>\n<pre class=\"lang:python decode:true \" title=\"How to run the TsTables benchmark with profiling information\">import cProfile\nimport tstables\n\ncProfile.run('tstables.Benchmark.main()','tstables.profile')</pre>\n<p>This will create a tstables.profile file in the current directory, which you can open with RunSnakeRun. Start RunSnakeRun by running <span class=\"lang:default highlight:0 decode:true  crayon-inline \">runsnake</span>  (assuming that PIP's bin folder is in your path).</p>\n","layout":"post","status":"publish","published":true,"title":"Installing WxPython and RunSnakeRun on Mac OSX 10.9","author":{"display_name":"afiedler","login":"afiedler","email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","url":""},"author_login":"afiedler","author_email":"andy@andyfiedler.com","wordpress_id":273,"wordpress_url":"http://andyfiedler.com/?p=273","date":"2014-05-28 09:37:42 -0400","date_gmt":"2014-05-28 13:37:42 -0400","categories":["Tech Notes"],"tags":[]}},"__N_SSG":true}
