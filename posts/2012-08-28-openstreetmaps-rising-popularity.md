<p>Craigslist is now using OpenStreetMap for showing the location of apartment listings! This is great for two reasons. First, looking for apartments will become much easier on Craigslist. Second, it's validation that OpenStreetMap's dataset is hugely valuable and robust enough for commercial use. Hopefully, I'll be rolling out my OpenStreetMap project within the next week or so. The project is a re-rendering of the basic slippy map with topographic lines and hiking trails taking more&nbsp;prominence. More to come!</p>
